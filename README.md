 Michael Dahl's Assignment 2
The following code is a preliminary exercise into data analysis that will eventually be implemented into my final project. 
I was unable to access the .dat file I needed for my actual project, so I chose to use class examples and include the code that I used to perform basic functions

For any questions regarding the code, please email mbd9413@nyu.edu. Thank you! Comments welcome.
